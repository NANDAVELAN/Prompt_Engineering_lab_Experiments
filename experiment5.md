# **Ex. No. 5: Comparative Analysis of Different Types of Prompting Patterns**

## **Aim**

To test and compare how ChatGPT responds to two distinct prompting styles — *naïve prompts* (broad, vague, and unstructured) and *basic prompts* (clear, structured, and detailed) — across multiple scenarios, and evaluate the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated outputs.

---

## **Algorithm / Procedure**

1. **Define Prompt Types**

   * Naïve Prompt: Broad, vague, unstructured.
   * Basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured with explicit instructions.

2. **Prepare Multiple Scenarios**

   * Select scenarios such as story writing, factual Q&A, summarization, advice, and technical tasks.
   * For each, create one naïve and one basic prompt.

3. **Run Experiments**

   * Input naïve prompt into ChatGPT, record response.
   * Input basic prompt, record response separately.

4. **Tabulate Results**

   * Maintain side-by-side comparison of both responses.

5. **Evaluate**

   * Analyze based on Quality, Accuracy, Depth, and Usefulness.

6. **Compare and Conclude**

   * Highlight which prompt type performs better and under what conditions.

## **Definition of Prompt Types**

* **Naïve Prompt:** General, lacks structure, often produces unfocused or shallow responses.
* **Basic Prompt:** Structured with context, constraints, and specific requirements that guide the AI toward more useful and accurate outputs.

## **Test Scenarios & Results**

| S.No | Scenario          | Naïve Prompt              | Basic Prompt                                                                   | Naïve Response (Summary)       | Basic Response (Summary)                    | Winner |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1    | Creative Story    | “Tell me a story.”        | “Write a story about a dragon who becomes a chef in a medieval kingdom.”       | Short, random, unfocused story | Clear, imaginative, structured with plot    | Basic  |
| 2    | Factual Question  | “What is AI?”             | “Explain Artificial Intelligence, its applications, and risks in 100 words.”   | One-line definition            | Detailed, with examples and risks           | Basic  |
| 3    | Summarization     | “Summarize the internet.” | “Summarize the history and impact of the Internet in under 150 words.”         | Very short, oversimplified     | Concise, covers history + impact            | Basic  |
| 4    | Study Tips        | “How can I study better?” | “Give me a 2-week daily study plan for exams with routines and stress tips.”   | Generic, common tips           | Structured daily plan with actionable steps | Basic  |
| 5    | Technical Example | “Write a Java program.”   | “Write a Java program to reverse a string with proper syntax and explanation.” | Incomplete, vague code         | Full code with explanation                  | Basic  |

### 8. ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES

**Naïve Prompting**

* ✅ Quick and easy to write.
* ✅ Useful for open-ended brainstorming.
* ❌ Leads to vague, generic, or shallow outputs.
* ❌ Poor at technical/structured tasks.

**Basic Prompting**

* ✅ Produces accurate, detailed, structured, and useful responses.
* ✅ Reduces ambiguity and misinterpretation.
* ❌ Requires more effort/time to design.
* ❌ May limit creativity if overly strict.

---

### ANALYSIS

* **Basic prompts consistently outperformed naïve prompts** in all 5 scenarios, particularly in tasks requiring detail, structure, or factual accuracy.
* **Naïve prompts worked acceptably well only for trivial factual queries**, but even there, basic prompts added extra value (historical context, nuance).
* The largest improvement was seen in **advice and coding tasks**, where naïve prompts gave superficial or incomplete answers, while basic prompts yielded actionable, robust, and user-focused outputs.

---

### CONCLUSION & FINAL RESULTS

This experiment demonstrates the **critical importance of prompt engineering**.
* **Naïve prompting** is suitable only for exploratory or creative brainstorming.
* **Basic prompting** yields superior results across quality, accuracy, depth, and usefulness — making it essential for professional, academic, or technical applications.
**Final Result:** *Well-structured, detailed prompts lead to consistently better AI performance. For reliable and context-rich outputs, basic prompting should always be preferred.*

## **Result**

Thus, the comparative analysis of prompting patterns was successfully carried out, and the importance of clear and structured prompts was demonstrated.
