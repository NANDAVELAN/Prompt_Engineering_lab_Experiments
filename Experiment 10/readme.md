## **Date:** 11/11/2025

## **Reg. No.:** 212223060182

---

## **Aim:**

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, answer engineering, and tail generation can be employed to create high-quality content like reports, articles, case studies, or creative works using AI models like ChatGPT.

---

## **Procedure:**

### 1. **Understanding Prompt Patterns:**

* **Query Decomposition:** Breaking a complex question into smaller parts.
* **Decision Making:** Allowing the model to select between possible directions.

* **Fact Check List:** Ensuring content accuracy.
* **Tail Generation:** Extending or deepening the content logically.
* **Semantic Filter:** Controlling tone, style, or complexity of content.

### 2. **Choosing the Content Type:**

Two test scenarios were selected:

1. **Business Report on Market Trends**
2. **Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

### 3. **Creating Prompts and Refining Outputs:**

Each content type began with a **basic prompt** and evolved through **refined prompts** applying the above techniques.

### **Final Refined Prompt (Semantic Filter + Tail Generation):**

> “Apply a **semantic filter** to make the report sound concise, factual, and industry-professional. Extend the ‘Future Outlook’ section using **tail generation** to include investment insights and policy recommendations.”

### **Final Output (Polished Version):**

#### **Final Report: Global Market Trends 2025**

The global economy is in a transformative phase in 2025, driven by digitalization and sustainability.
**Emerging Sectors** like AI, renewable energy, and smart manufacturing dominate investment portfolios.
**Challenges** such as regulatory uncertainty, cybersecurity, and global inflation require adaptive strategies.

**Future Outlook:**
Governments must incentivize green technology and digital infrastructure. Investors should diversify into clean energy, automation startups, and fintech solutions. The convergence of sustainability and innovation will define the next growth cycle of the global market.

## **Test Case 2: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

### **Initial Simple Prompt:**

> “Write a short sci-fi story about life on Mars.”

### **Output (First Draft):**

Humans settled on Mars after Earth became uninhabitable. A young explorer discovers a hidden cave with strange lights, revealing an ancient Martian civilization.

---

### **Refined Prompt using Decision-Making and Tail Generation:**

> “Create a **sci-fi short story** set on Mars in 2089. Choose one of the following themes:
> a) Discovery of alien intelligence
> b) Survival after a storm
> c) A rebellion among colonists.
> Make a **decision** and expand the story with **tail generation** to include character emotions, dialogues, and moral reflection.”

### **Refined Output:**

**Title:** *The Whispering Red Storm*
Theme Chosen: **Survival after a storm**

In 2089, Commander Elara and her crew faced the worst dust storm in Martian history. Their habitat’s power core failed, leaving oxygen levels dropping. As panic spread, Elara whispered, “Mars tests us not with war, but with silence.”

After 72 hours, when they finally repaired the solar grid, she recorded a message:

> “Survival isn’t about fighting nature. It’s about learning to breathe with it.”

The Martian wind carried her words across the desert—proof that courage could echo, even where life itself struggled to survive.

---

### **Final Refined Prompt (Semantic Filter + Answer Engineering):**

> “Apply a **semantic filter** for cinematic storytelling. Maintain a reflective tone, use vivid sensory descriptions, and end with a philosophical note.”

### **Final Output (Polished Story):**

**Title:** *Echoes Beneath the Red Sky*

Mars, 2089. The colony’s domes glowed faintly under a crimson haze. Commander Elara pressed her gloved hand against the cracked viewport, watching dust whirl like a sea of fire. The storm had taken everything—communication, power, and hope.

Inside the darkened habitat, the faint heartbeat of the emergency generator pulsed like life itself. “If Mars wants silence,” Elara murmured, “then we’ll answer with persistence.”

When dawn broke, the storm faded into calm. The red sky cleared, revealing Earth’s tiny blue glimmer above. Elara smiled. Humanity’s echo had reached the stars—and Mars had finally whispered back.
