## **Aim:**

To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for AI-based video generation and understand how text-based inputs can influence the style, motion, and content of generated videos.

---

## **Algorithm:**

1. **Explore AI Video Generation Models:**
   Study and familiarize yourself with AI tools capable of creating videos from text prompts such as:

   * **Runway Gen-2** – cinematic and realistic text-to-video generation
   * **Synthesia** – avatar-based video generation for presentations
   * **Pictory** – script-to-video summarization
   * **DeepBrain** – realistic talking avatars for business and education

2. **Create Simple Prompts:**
   Begin with basic prompts describing the main subject or action.
   Example: *“A person walking in a park.”*

3. **Add Detailed Prompts:**
   Add more details such as lighting, background, actions, or weather conditions.
   Example: *“A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path with birds flying.”*

4. **Include Time and Motion Elements:**
   Incorporate camera movement or transitions.
   Example: *“A time-lapse of the sun setting over the ocean with the camera zooming out.”*

5. **Experiment with Styles:**
   Try various visual types like cinematic, animated, or realistic.
   Example: *“An animated futuristic city at night with neon lights and flying cars.”*

6. **Iterate and Refine:**
   Review and modify prompts to improve pacing, camera angles, or visual clarity.

7. **Generate and Compare Outputs:**
   Generate multiple outputs with slightly different prompt phrasing and observe variations.

## **Input and Output:**

### **Video Generation: Prompt 1**

**Input Prompt:**

> *“A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene.”*

**Output Description:**
The AI-generated video displayed a **dynamic nighttime cityscape** illuminated by **bright neon signs and glowing reflections** on wet roads. The camera followed a **car moving rapidly through traffic**, creating a **high-speed cinematic effect** with **motion blur, light trails, and realistic reflections** on buildings and streets. The output conveyed an intense, movie-like atmosphere consistent with the prompt.

### **Video Generation: Prompt 2**

**Input Prompt:**

> *“A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from the beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky.”*

**Output Description:**
The AI generated a **smooth time-lapse sequence** showing the **sun lowering on the horizon**, with **warm orange and pink hues** spreading across the sky. The **camera zoomed out slowly**, capturing the **waves gently hitting the shore** and creating a serene, cinematic visual.

---

### **Video Generation: Prompt 3**

**Input Prompt:**

> *“An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people.”*

**Output Description:**
The generated video showcased a **vibrant animated city** filled with **futuristic skyscrapers, floating vehicles, and glowing signage**. The **camera panned across busy streets**, showing **crowds of people and neon-lit billboards**, giving a **cyberpunk-style visual experience**.

---

## **Observation:**

* AI tools like **Runway Gen-2** and **DeepBrain** produced highly realistic and cinematic results.
* Detailed prompts with lighting, mood, and action cues generated more vivid and accurate visuals.
* Abstract or minimal prompts resulted in less defined or generic outputs.
* Small wording changes in prompts significantly altered the video composition and motion.

---

## **Result:**

The experiment on exploring various prompting techniques for AI-based video generation was successfully completed.
It was observed that **the realism, artistic style, and accuracy of generated videos depend heavily on the specificity, structure, and creativity of the prompt used.**
